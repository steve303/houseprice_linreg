Method Discussion points
Data pre-processing:
- Year Renovated to boolean (because we have 0 years which doesn't make sense)
- Removing basement (high correlation)

Pre-model building:
- Look at pairs
- Look at correlations

Model building:
1. Try Additive
2. Step Additive (forms baseline RMSE from which to improve)
3. Try 2-way interactive 
4. Try 3-way interactive (note it's a dead end -overfitting)
5. Try 2-way interactive without zip interaction (to reduce num of predictors)
6. Try 2-way interactive with polynomials, note not much different with all polynomial
7. Try specific polynomials (with info from pairs graphs)
8. AIC the result
9. Which model is chosen
